# lacity-citation-parser
A simple script to parse parking citation data from the City of Los Angeles.

This script is for those who have already found CMBleakley's first parser (https://github.com/CMBleakley/citation-formatter), but are not yet brave enough to use Node.

Useage:
`python parse_parking.py --input [raw csv]`
